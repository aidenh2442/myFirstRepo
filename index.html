        Founded in 2003, High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies is a highly competitive high school with a mix of Native English and Mandarin speakers. It provides students with a multifaceted curriculum based on a dual-language education system, which means that students will take a Mandarin course daily on top of their extensive math and science classes. All students that attend the school are required to pass the Chinese Regents and the AP Chinese Exam, in addition to eight other exams needed for an Advanced Regents diploma.
